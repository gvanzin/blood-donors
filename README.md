# predicting blood donors

#### In collaboration with a global medical device manufacturer, Iâ€™m analyzing instrument performance data from blood collection devices. From this analysis, we hope to gain insight at the patient/instrument interface, and learn methods to improve the patient experience as well as the blood collection process.  This problem involves overcoming big data ETL issues by bridging the gap between proprietary and open source tools.
